# DATA-Visualization
This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using the Iris dataset. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and creating visualizations such as pair plots, heatmaps, histograms, and box plots using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Visualization Project
This Python project demonstrates data visualization techniques using the Iris dataset. The project explores and presents key insights through various visualizations, making the data more understandable and actionable.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species of the iris flower.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and performed data transformation to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Visualization Techniques: Created various types of visualizations including:
Pair Plots: To explore relationships between features.
Heatmaps: To visualize the correlation matrix.
Histograms: To display the distribution of each feature.
Box Plots: To show the spread and outliers of each feature.
Tools and Libraries
Python: Main programming language used for the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
